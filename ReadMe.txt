# Weekly Payment Generation Program

## Project Overview
This program was developed for Highridge Construction Company to facilitate weekly payments for its workers. The program generates payment slips for 400 dynamically created workers and assigns them employee levels based on salary and gender conditions. 

The program is implemented in both Python and R and includes exception handling to manage errors during payment slip generation.

## Features
- Generates a list of 400 workers dynamically.
- Assigns random salaries and genders to workers.
- Uses conditional statements to assign employee levels.
- Implements exception handling to manage potential errors during payment slip generation.
- Both Python and R versions of the program are provided.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- RStudio 2024.09.0 
- VScode

## How to Run the Program

### Python
1. Ensure you have Python installed in VScode.
2. Run the Python script `BAN6420 Module 1 Assignment.py`.
3. The program will generate payment slips for 400 workers in the terminal.

### R
1. Ensure you have R installed in VScode.
2. Run the R script `BAN6420 Module 1 Assignment.R`.
3. Payment slips for 400 workers will be printed in the R console.

## Exception Handling
The program includes exception handling to catch any errors that may arise while generating worker payment slips. These errors will be printed to the console, and the program will continue running for other workers.
